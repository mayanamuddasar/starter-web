Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that BJP may have suffered in the Delhi assembly elections because of controversial statements made by some party leaders even as he strongly denied the assessment that loss in Delhi was a verdict on CAA or NRC. Speaking at the Times Now summit, Amit Shah said the BJP immediately distanced itself from such remarks.
